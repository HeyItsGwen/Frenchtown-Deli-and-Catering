#About this project

This site was created as a redesign for a local (to me) restaurant who's website was outdated and deprecated. It's a static single page site made entirely with vanilla js, bootstrap, and sass. The different "pages" on the site work similarly to react, but don't rely on components/frameworks to do the heavy lifting.

The deployed site can be found [here.](https://heyitsgwen.github.io/Frenchtown-Deli-and-Catering/)
